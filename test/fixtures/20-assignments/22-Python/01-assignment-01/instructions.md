# Python Assignment 01: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview
Explore Python's built-in data structures and implement fundamental algorithms.

## Objectives
- Master Python lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples
- Implement searching and sorting algorithms
- Practice file I/O operations
- Understand time and space complexity

## Requirements
1. Implement a contact management system
2. Support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
3. Store data in JSON format
4. Implement search functionality with multiple criteria
5. Add data validation and error handling
6. Include unit tests for all functions

## Deliverables
- `contact_manager.py` - Main application
- `data_handler.py` - File I/O operations
- `utils.py` - Helper functions
- `test_contact_manager.py` - Unit tests
- `contacts.json` - Sample data file

## Technical Specifications
- Use Python 3.8+ features
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include type hints
- Implement proper exception handling

## Testing Requirements
- Achieve 90%+ code coverage
- Include edge case testing
- Test error conditions

## Grading Criteria
- Algorithm implementation: 30%
- Code structure: 25%
- Testing: 25%
- Documentation: 20%
