# JavaScript Assignment 02: Asynchronous Programming

## Overview

Learn advanced JavaScript concepts including promises, async/await, and API
integration.

## Objectives

- Understand asynchronous JavaScript patterns
- Practice working with APIs and JSON
- Implement error handling for network requests
- Build a dynamic web application

## Requirements

2. Fetch data from a public weather API
3. Display current weather and 5-day forecast
4. Implement search functionality by city
5. Add geolocation support
6. Include loading states and error handling

## Deliverables

- `index.html` - Application layout
